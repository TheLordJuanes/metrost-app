Metro Trost, assumed a double challenge: the construction and operation of its transportation system, it is in charge of the design, construction and start-up of the ISMT, of passengers for Trost, based on the definitions technical, legal and financial provided by investment banking.

Metrost will be the ISMT of Trost. The system is operated by articulated, standard and complementary buses, which move through trunk, pre-trunk and complementary corridors covering trunk, pre-trunk and feeder routes.

This mass transportation system has multiple stations located throughout the city, as well as numerous bus stops in smaller areas, in order to provide transportation service in as many places as possible.
Metro Trost is looking to renovate and redistribute the stations in the city, therefore, the company has asked us to create a program to plan the design of the stations’ connections in which they can modify the number of stations and the connections between them, as well as provide the shortest route from a specific station to another, taking into account the already existing stations. The program must also allow the addition of the stations in mass using csv files. Finally, the information or connections of the stations can be consulted in the program.
